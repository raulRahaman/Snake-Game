# Snake-Game
I have this project where I am trying to implement a second apple in the classic snake game. 

Feature:
There would be some simple true or false questions at the top of the screen and the user would have to decide which apple to eat in order to progress and for the snake to grow.

Issue:
I am currently stuck as for some reason when I implemented a second apple the snake seemed to stopped eating any of the apples and completely ignores them by going over through them.
